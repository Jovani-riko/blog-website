<p style="color: blue;">
    its made up of text and we also have a <strong><em>markup</em></strong> which can describes a refernces<br>
    for example it could be to add an image or to add a web address to the txt, <br>
    and things like how the txt should be desplayed in the broser like bold, <br>
    itallics....(strong, en) <br>

    <br>



    <sub>


    whitespace<br></p>

can contain a space, tab, linebrake and however many spaces or tabs are put in a text<br><br></sub>
unless i tell the browser that i need like multiple spaces or tab or a linebreak <br>
the browser will render the txt without the space so one example is to use the break element<br>

tags which doesnt have any closing tags are called void elements or empty elements<br>

list and closing tag requirments

a list can be of two types which are orderd list <ol> and </ol>
unorded list which is ul 
the li element should always be nested in one of the two types of lists ol or 
and for the li element the closing tag is optional but not for the type of list ol or ul 
when no closing tag is provided for the li the browser will know where to end this element
by refering to when the next li occurs in the code <br>
another type of element that has this optional closing tag requirments is the paragraph or p
